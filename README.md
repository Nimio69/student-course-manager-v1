# student-course-manager-v1

This is a simple **C# console application** I built to practice C#, SQL, and working with databases.

The goal of this project was to improve my programming fundamentals and get more comfortable using SQLite and ADO.NET in a real project instead of only doing small exercises.

## What the program does

- Lets you add students
- Lets you add courses
- Lets you enroll students in courses
- Saves everything in a SQLite database
- Runs fully in the console

## Technologies used

- C#
- .NET Framework 4.8
- SQLite
- ADO.NET
- Visual Studio

## Database structure (simple)

The database has three tables:

- Students
- Courses
- Enrollments

Students can be enrolled in multiple courses, and courses can have multiple students.

## How to run it:

- Clone the repo  
   
   git clone https://github.com/Nimio69/student-course-manager-v1.git
   
   git clone https://github.com/Nimio69/student-course-manager-v1.git
